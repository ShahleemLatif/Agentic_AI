    "# Automated AI Sales Email Generation System\n",

    "## 📖 Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a multi-agent AI system for automating the creation and sending of cold sales emails for a fictional company, **Pet Vet**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is as follows:\n",
    "1.  **Draft Generation**: Three distinct AI agents, each with a unique personality (professional, humorous, concise), generate email drafts.\n",
    "2.  **Selection**: A `Senior Sales Manager` agent reviews the drafts and selects the most promising one.\n",
    "3.  **Formatting & Sending**: The selected draft is handed off to an `Email Manager` agent, which generates a subject line, converts the body to HTML, and sends the final email using the SendGrid API."
