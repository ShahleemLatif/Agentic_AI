# Module: accounts.py

This module implements a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It provides functionalities to create an account, manage funds, record trades, calculate portfolio value, and generate various reports related to account transactions and holdings.

## Class: Account

### Attributes:
- `username: str`: The unique identifier for the user account.
- `balance: float`: The current cash balance of the account.
- `transactions: List[Dict[str, Union[str, int, float]]]`: A list to store all transactions including deposits, withdrawals, and buy/sell records. Each transaction is a dictionary.
- `holdings: Dict[str, int]`: A dictionary mapping stock symbols to quantities held by the account.
- `initial_deposit: float`: The initial deposit made to the account, used for profit/loss calculation.

### Methods:

#### `__init__(self, username: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
Initialize a new account with a username and an initial deposit.

#### `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
Add funds to the account balance and record the transaction.

#### `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
Attempt to withdraw funds from the account balance, ensuring no negative balance occurs. Return `True` if successful, else `False`.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
Attempt to purchase shares of a given symbol at the current price. Adjust the balance and holdings if successful. Prevent purchase if funds are insufficient. Return `True` if successful, else `False`.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
Attempt to sell shares of a given symbol. Adjust the balance and holdings if successful. Prevent sale if shares are insufficient. Return `True` if successful, else `False`.

#### `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
Calculate and return the current total value of the portfolio, including cash balance and the value of held shares.

#### `get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`
Calculate and return the profit or loss from the initial deposit.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> Dict[str, int]`
Provide a dictionary representation of current stock holdings.

#### `get_transaction_history(self) -> List[Dict[str, Union[str, int, float]]]`
Return the list of all transactions made by the account, in chronological order.

### Dependencies:

#### `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
Externally provided function that returns the current price of a share for a given symbol. Test implementation returns fixed prices for known symbols, e.g., AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL.

#### Note:
- The module should be designed to be entirely self-contained. Error-handling should be included for cases such as invalid transactions or operations.
- Consider implementing logging within each method to provide useful debug information if required.
