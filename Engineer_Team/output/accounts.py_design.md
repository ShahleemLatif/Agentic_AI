This module is designed to manage user accounts for a trading simulation platform. It allows users to manage their portfolio by providing functionality to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, buy and sell shares, and track their transactions, holdings, and profit or loss.

## Class and Methods Design

### Class: `Account`

#### Attributes:
- `user_id: int` - Unique identifier for the user.
- `balance: float` - Represents the current balance of the user.
- `initial_deposit: float` - Represents the total initial deposit amount.
- `holdings: Dict[str, int]` - Dictionary to keep track of shares held by the user, with share symbol as key and quantity as value.
- `transactions: List[Dict]` - List to store transaction records as dictionaries containing transaction details.

#### Methods:

- `__init__(self, user_id: int) -> None`
  - Initializes a new account with a specified user_id. Sets balance and initial_deposit to 0, and initializes holdings and transactions as empty structures.

- `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
  - Increases the user's balance by the specified amount. Also increases initial_deposit by the same amount if it's the initial deposit transaction.

- `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
  - Decreases the user's balance by the specified amount. Ensures that the balance does not fall below zero.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> None`
  - Records the purchase of shares if the user has sufficient funds. Checks the current share price using the `get_share_price(symbol)` function to ensure the user can afford the purchase. Updates holdings and records the transaction.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> None`
  - Records the sale of shares if the user has enough shares in holdings. Updates holdings and balance, and records the transaction.

- `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
  - Calculates the total value of the user's portfolio by summing the value of all shares held at current prices, along with the current balance.

- `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`
  - Calculates the profit or loss by comparing the current total balance (including portfolio value) with the initial deposit.

- `report_holdings(self) -> Dict[str, int]`
  - Returns the current holdings of the user (number of shares per symbol).

- `report_profit_loss(self) -> float`
  - Returns the current profit or loss value for the user.

- `list_transactions(self) -> List[Dict]`
  - Provides a chronological list of all transactions made by the user.

### Utilities

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
  - Simulated function to return the current price of a share. This will be provided in the simulation environment and not implemented within this module.

This module is designed to be self-contained and supports all functional requirements described for a trading simulation platform account management. Each function is equipped with validations to prevent invalid financial operations as specified.

This design outlines the `Account` class and explains the attributes and methods necessary to implement the specified functionality. It is ready to receive implementation, testing, and further integration with a UI or other components.
